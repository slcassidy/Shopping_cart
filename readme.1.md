# Shopping Cart

### Overview

For this assignment you will be building a simple shopping cart application. Upon visiting the website, the user will be presented with a list of items on the left as well as a shopping cart on the right. When the user selects an item from the left, it will be added and updated to the shopping cart. If a user attempts to add an item that already exists in their shopping cart, a message will be displayed alerting them that that item has already been added. 

The shopping cart has some additional functionality as well. First, the user will be able to click items to remove it from their shopping cart. After an item has been removed from their shopping cart, they are then able to add it again from the list of all items. Second, the user is able to filter the list of all items by category.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `shopping-cart`, then clone it to your computer.

2. Inside the `shopping-cart` folder, create an `index.html` file.

3. Still inside the `shopping-cart` directory, make a folder called `assets`.
   * Inside the `assets` directory, make three additional folders: `javascript` and `css`.
     * In the `javascript` folder, make a file called `index.js`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.

4. Set up your repository to deploy to Github Pages.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub.
